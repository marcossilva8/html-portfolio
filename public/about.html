<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, my name is Marcos and I am 17 years old. I currently study at a technical school in Brazil studying Systems Development.</p>
<p>I've always really liked games and technology, until I discovered the world of programming and fell in love with it. Today, I think about finishing my studies and looking for a job in the IT area as a Front-End, but I still have a dream of one day becoming a great Game Developer.</p>
<p>Currently, in addition to school, I am taking the course "The Complete 2024 Web Development Bootcamp" to expand my knowledge about Front-End, since at school I only learn the basics.</p>
